    <p>So he has contributed a lot to humanity and his works shall forever remain an immesurable treasure. His life
        was not in vain , althought one would find that he himself suffered a lot . Perhaps it is the fate of the great minds to become something abnormal
        or perhaps greatness is beyond normality.Who knows where life will lead us.
